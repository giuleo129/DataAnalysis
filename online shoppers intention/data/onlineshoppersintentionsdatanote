Target Variable to predicted: "Revenue" (in the training set)
Two classes : "TRUE", "FALSE"

The folder contains three datasets:

train data: about 80% of the units of the original dataset
test data: about 20% of the units of the original dataset

The test set does not contain the target variable. The true values of the target variable will be discussed during the exam.

Main steps of the analysis for the report:

1. Provide Exploratory Data Analysis of the training data set
2. Find the best model for the training data (among those presented in the course)
3. Apply the model to the test data and predict the target values
4. Provide the file of the test data with the predicted values
